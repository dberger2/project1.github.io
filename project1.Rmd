# 1 Requirements

List of functions used with the NASA NEO API, I used the following packages:

* `tidyverse`: tons of useful features for data manipulation and visualization
* `jsonlite`: API interaction

In addition to those packages, I used the following packages in the rest of the document:

* `httr`: useful tools for Working with URLs and HTTP  
* `dplyr`:  A fast, consistent tool for working with data frame like objects, both in memory and out of memory.  
* `ggplot`:  A system for 'declaratively' creating graphics, based on "The Grammar of Graphics"
* `purrr`: A complete and consistent functional programming toolkit for R
* `lubriate`: consistent and memorable syntax that makes working with dates easy and fun
* `janitor`: simple functions for examining and cleaning dirty data

# 2 Introduction

This project was super fun, I had no idea what to expect when starting it, but as I immersed myself in the world of API's, I became enthralled with the data I was compiling.  I ended up using the NASA Near Earth Object Web Service.  The API I called was very limited in its search parameters (only three, start date, end date, and API key).  Additionally, the API only allows you to pull seven days per call.  All that being said, it did return a lot of interesting information which I was able to wrangle into some useful tables and visualizations.

The crux of the analysis speaks to how much damage and asteroid could do to the Earth and if asteroids are potentially hazardous.  All that being said, based on some of the date ranges are pulled, I think we'll be okay.

```{R, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("_pics/asteroid.PNG")
```

# 3 Function to contact API and Inspect the Data

The `asteroidcall` function below is used to query the NASA NEO API.  As mentioned above, it only accepts three parameters (start_date, end_date, and api_key).  Given a `demo_key` can be used for the API, the user only needs to enter the start and end dates of the seven day period they would like to pull data from.  For this example, data from  time frame of late September to early October 1998 was pulled.


``` {r}
asteroidcall <- function(start_date, end_date){GET(url = "https://api.nasa.gov/neo/rest/v1/feed?",
                  query = list(
                    start_date = start_date,
                    end_date = start_date,
                    api_key = "DEMO_KEY",
  str(asteroid, max.level = 1)))
  return(asteroid)
}

asteroidcall("1998-09-27", "1998-10-02")
```

## 3.1 Converting the data in the API Call to a Tibble

It is a fairly laborious process to get the data from the API call into a usable data frame/tibble.  Each day queried returns its own data frame.  This requires all the data frames being combined into one.  Luckily the columns are all the same.  Once the `JSON` conversion is complete, `do.call("rbind")` is required to combine all the data frames into one.  There are three columns which are not usable or of value so the `subset()` function was used to remove them.  The final step was ordering the columns into something a bit more user friendly.

```{r asteroid data, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
asteroiddata = fromJSON(rawToChar(asteroid$content), flatten = TRUE)
asteroiddata2 <- do.call("rbind", asteroiddata$near_earth_objects)
asteroiddata2 <- subset(asteroiddata2, select = -c(neo_reference_id, links.self, close_approach_data))
asteroiddata2 <- asteroiddata2[ ,c(1,2,5,4,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,3)]
```


## 3.2 Renaming the Columns

At this point, we have a usable data frame we can start clearing up a bit more.  Some of the column names were a bit long, so the following code was used to turn them into something a little more readable.

```{r rename columns, r asteroid data, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE}
asteroiddata2 <- as_tibble(plyr::rename(asteroiddata2, c(
  "id" = "Asteroid_ID",
  "name" = "Asteroid_Name", 
  "is_potentially_hazardous_asteroid" = "potentially_hazardous",
  "absolute_magnitude_h" = "magnitude",
  "is_sentry_object" = "sentry_object",
  "estimated_diameter.kilometers.estimated_diameter_min" = "est_diameter_km_min",
  "estimated_diameter.kilometers.estimated_diameter_max" = "est_diameter_km_max",
  "estimated_diameter.meters.estimated_diameter_min" = "est_diameter_meter_min",
  "estimated_diameter.meters.estimated_diameter_max" = "est_diameter_meter_max",
  "estimated_diameter.miles.estimated_diameter_min" = "est_diameter_miles_min",
  "estimated_diameter.miles.estimated_diameter_max" = "est_diameter_miles_max",
  "estimated_diameter.feet.estimated_diameter_min" = "est_diameter_feet_min",
  "estimated_diameter.feet.estimated_diameter_max" = "est_diameter_feet_max")))
```


## 3.3 Adding levels to Two Columns

Two of the columns returned true/false values, so this codes adds levels and changes those elements to names that were easier to understand the context of what was being communicated.  This enabled a better understanding of the visualizations further down in the project.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
asteroiddata2$potentially_hazardous <- as.factor(asteroiddata2$potentially_hazardous)
  levels(asteroiddata2$potentially_hazardous) <- c('Not Potentially Hazardous','Potentially Hazardous')
asteroiddata2$sentry_object <- as.factor(asteroiddata2$sentry_object)
  levels(asteroiddata2$sentry_object) <- c('No','Yes')
```


## 3.4 Adding a categorical variable - `Damage Estimate`

A number of the columns in the data frame give information on the estimated size of the asteroids returned in the API call.  I was able to find some information which provided the level of damage an asteroid could inflict on Earth if it were to impact the planet based on the asteroids `diameter in meters`.  The code below created a new categorical variable and applies the different damage classifications based on the estimated diameter of the asteroid in meters.

The categories are as follows:

* `High Altitude Break-up`:     Diameter < `30` meters
* `Regional Event`:             Diameter < `300` meters
* `Large sub-global event`:     Diameter < `600` meters
* `Low Global Effect`:          Diameter < `1000` meters
* `Medium Global Effect`:       Diameter < `5000` meters
* `Large Global Effect`:        Diameter < `10000` meters
* `Extinction Event`:           Diameter > `10000` meters


```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
asteroiddata2 <- asteroiddata2 %>% 
  mutate(damage_est = if_else(asteroiddata2$est_diameter_meter_max < 30, "High Altitude Break-up",
                                                        if_else(asteroiddata2$est_diameter_meter_max <= 300, "Regional Event",
                                                                if_else(asteroiddata2$est_diameter_meter_max <= 600, "Large sub-global event",
                                                                        if_else(asteroiddata2$est_diameter_meter_max <= 1000, "Low Global Effect",
                                                                                if_else(asteroiddata2$est_diameter_meter_max <= 5000, "Medium Global Effect",
                                                                                        if_else(asteroiddata2$est_diameter_meter_max <= 10000, "Large Global Effect", "Extinction Event",)))))))
```

## 3.5  Adding a new continuous variable `Diameter Range`

A second variable was added to the data frame.  The data provided by the API gives an estimated maximum diameter in meters and an estimated minimum in meters.  This new variable provides the range between the max and min estimate for comparison and helps understand how distant some of the estimations are.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
asteroiddata2 <- as_tibble(asteroiddata2)%>% mutate(diameter_range = asteroiddata2$est_diameter_meter_max - asteroiddata2$est_diameter_meter_min)
```


## 3.6 The final tibble!

And here we are, after all the data wrangling we end up with a useful tibble to base our analysis from and work with!

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
asteroiddata2
```


# 4 Second API Endpoint Call

Given some of the limitations as stated above with the search parameters for the `NASA NEO API` I did see if there was another relevant API to query.  I did come across one administered by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  This one enabled me to pull a list of asteroids that have been removed from the `NASA Sentry List`.  The Sentry List identifies all asteroids which pose a somewhat relevant threat to Earth.  There were no parameters to specifically query for this API, other than to see what asteroids were removed from the list.

This data was tricky to work with, so I had to `unlist()` and repackage it into a tibble.  Once that was complete, I renamed the column headers to mirror the tibble from the `NASA NEO API` call.  


```{r API call asteroid browse api, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
removedsentry <- "https://ssd-api.jpl.nasa.gov/sentry.api?removed=1"
removedsentry <- httr::GET(removedsentry)
removedsentry <- removedsentry %>% 
  httr::content() %>%
  unlist() %>% 
  matrix(ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE) %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  janitor::row_to_names(row_number = 1)
removedsentry <- as_tibble(plyr::rename(removedsentry, c("2837" = "Asteroid_Name",
  "NASA/JPL Sentry Data API" = "Date_Removed")))
```

# 5 Table join

With the headers from the second API call updated, I was able to join the tibbles from the first and second API calls using a `left_join()`.  This enabled the addition of a column to see if any of the asteroids in the tibble were previously on the `NASA Sentry List` and what date they were removed.  This provided a nice addition to data, given the `NASA NEO API` already provides a column stating if the asteroid is currently on the Sentry list.  The Tibble below is the final tibble to start conducting analysis from for the rest of the project.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
asteroiddata3 <- left_join(asteroiddata2, removedsentry, by = "Asteroid_Name")
asteroiddata3
```

# 6 Contingeny Tables

## 6.1 Two-way Contingency Table

The two-way contingency table below shows the count of asteroids that are potentially hazardous vs. not potentially hazardous and the damage they could inflict if they were to impact the Earth.  For this timeframe, there were two that were potentially hazardous that would have resulted in a `Medium Global event`.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
knitr::kable(table(asteroiddata3$damage_est, asteroiddata3$potentially_hazardous),
             caption = paste("Potentially vs Non-Potentially Hazardous Asteroids", "by destruction potetial"))
```

## 6.2 Three-Way Contingency Table

The three-way contingency table below takes what was provided above in the two-way table and further categorizes based on if the asteroids were on the `NASA Sentry list` or not.  As a reminder, the Sentry list are the asteroids NASA is keeping a close watch on.  Luckily none of them were!

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
table(asteroiddata3$damage_est, asteroiddata3$potentially_hazardous, asteroiddata3$sentry_object)
```

# 7 Summary Statistics

The function below was written to provide summary statistics for the estimated asteroid diameters in the table.  The user can specify if they want to see summaries for `estimated maximum diameters` in `Kilometers`, `Meters`, `Miles`, or `Feet`.  I made a few attempts to try and simplify the function parameters, but ultimately the tibble object and associated column name need to be used for the function to work properly.

The table below shows summary statistics for `estimated maximum diameter in meters` using `asteroiddata3$est_diameter_meter_max` as the parameter.

```{r summary asteroid2 data, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
astsumcall <- function(x){asteroiddata3 %>%
    summarise("Min." = min(x),
              "1st Quartile" = quantile(x, 0.25),
              "Median" = quantile(x, 0.5),
              "Mean" = mean(x),
              "3rd Quartile" = quantile(x, 0.75),
              "Max" = max(x),
              "Std. Dev" = sd(x),
              "IQR" = IQR(x))
  }

asteroidstats <- astsumcall(asteroiddata3$est_diameter_meter_max)

knitr::kable(asteroidstats, 
             caption="Summary Statistics of Estimated Maximum Diameter of Asteroids Observed during the Specified Timeframe",
             digits=2)


```

# 8 Visualisations

## 8.1 Boxplotes of `asteroid size` grouped by `hazardous` / `non-hazardous`

This plot shows the box plots for `estimated maximum diameter in meters` and groups them by whether or not the asteroids are `hazardous`.

```{r , echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
BPH <- ggplot(data = asteroiddata3, aes(x = potentially_hazardous, y = est_diameter_meter_max)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_point(aes(color = potentially_hazardous), position = "jitter") + labs(y = "Max_Diameter_km", title="Boxplot for Diameter in Meters Grouped by Hazard Category") 
BPH
```


## 8.2 Boxplot size of asteroids grouped by `Damage Potential`

Another boxplot was created this time grouping the size of the asteroids by the `damage` they could inflict if they impacted Earth.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
BPH <- ggplot(data = asteroiddata3, aes(x = damage_est, y = est_diameter_meter_max)) + geom_point(aes(color = damage_est), position = "jitter") + geom_boxplot() + labs(x = "Damage Potential", y = "Max_Diameter_Meters", title="Boxplot for Diameter in Meters Grouped by Damage Potential") + guides(x=guide_axis(angle=45))
BPH
```


## 8.3 Bar chart showing counts of `Damage Potetial` and `Hazard Category`

The bar chart shows the count of asteroids categorized by the `damage` they could inflict if they impacted Earth and if they are considered `potentially hazardous`.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
BCD <- ggplot(data = asteroiddata3, aes(y = damage_est)) + geom_bar(aes(fill = as.factor(potentially_hazardous)), position = "dodge") + labs(y = "Damage Potential") + scale_fill_discrete(name = "") + guides(y=guide_axis(angle=45))
BCD
```

## 8.4 Scatterplot Groups by `Hazard Potential` and `Damage Potential`

The scatter plot shows the clustering of asteroids by whether they are `hazardous` and the `damage` they could inflict if they impacted Earth.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
ASCT <- ggplot(data = asteroiddata3, aes(y = potentially_hazardous, x = damage_est)) + geom_jitter(aes(color = damage_est)) + guides(x=guide_axis(angle=45))
ASCT
```

## 8.5 Correlation of `Asteroid Diameter` and `Magnitude`

This chart examines the correlation between an asteroids `size` and its `brightness`.  NASA and JPL use the term `absolute magnitude` to determine how bright a celestial object is.  The lower the magnitude, the brighter the object, or put another way, the more luminous an object, the smaller the numerical value of its magnitude.  The chart below shows the larger an asteroid is, the brighter it is.  Looking at some research online, this makes sense, and probably also explains why other planets in the solar system look like really bright stars when we can see them in the sky at night.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
CDRE <- ggplot(data = asteroiddata3, aes(y = magnitude, x = est_diameter_meter_max)) + geom_point(aes(color = magnitude), position = "jitter") + geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = "loess") + labs(x = "Asteroid Diameter in Meters", y = "Magnitude", title="Correlation of Asteroid Diameter vs Magnitude") 
CDRE
```
